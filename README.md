### This is Redacted

A project for [Investigate West](http://www.invw.org/), Oregon lawmakers have carved out more than 470 exemptions to our state's open records law. We built [this tool](http://www.invw.org/redacted/) to help you search those exemptions. Search by key word, state agency, statute number, or use the suggested terms below to search by topic.

And [sign up for Redacted](http://eepurl.com/uqpNL), a monthly look at our stateâ€™s state of transparency: loopholes, the stories behind the exemptions, the inevitably proposed new ones. Redacted is written by [Lee van der Voo](http://www.invw.org/author/lee-van-der-voo) for [InvestigateWest](http://www.invw.org/).
